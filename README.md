#js cellular automata
<<<<<<< HEAD
Something to play around with cellular automata wich i've written in js and some bootstrap to give the page a decent and zero offert layout.  
Once the page is loaded a 2d cellular automata will be evolved downward, the starting cells (the first row) are random and you can edit the rules or randomize them and then run the evolution again.  
If you are familiar with formal languages this can be seen as some kind of context-sensitive language.  

[Example of a picture you can generate.](example.png)  

The size of the image is proportional to the window of your browser when you run the automata.
